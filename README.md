This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python: the use of a bare 'except Exception' clause in exception handling.  The code includes an example function that illustrates the problem and a solution that replaces the bare 'except' with more specific exception handling.  This allows the program to handle the different type of errors appropriately, improve code readability and aid in debugging.
